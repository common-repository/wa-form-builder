= Why is the user-interface not displaying correctly? =
Your theme's style.css might be interfering with the default css of the plugin. To customize the way the plugin is displayed in your theme either create styles overwriting the the styles called from /X Forms/css/ui.css or customize /X Forms/css/ui.css to suit your theme.
